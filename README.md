# 2wd Obstacle Avoiding Robot using Arduino

![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/r5e2oub.jpg)
An obstacle avoiding robot is a fully autonomous robot which can be able to avoid any obstacle which it face when it move. Simply, when it met an obstacle while it moving forward, automatically stop moving forward and makes a step back. Then it looks it's two sides left & right and starts to move the best possible way; which means either in left direction if there is another obstacle in right or in right direction if there is another obstacle in left side. The obstacle avoiding robot is very helpful and it is the base of many large projects such as Automatic cars, robots used in Manufacturing factories, even in robots used in spacecrafts.

Note: Make sure you get a range of different colours for the wires (eg. red for voltage, black for ground, etc.). Some items such as the battery enclosure, motors and servo motor may come with wires so you may not need to purchase these separately. Some motor modules or sensor shields may use different pins (eg. male or female or just bare-ended wires).

Below are images of the main components you need (apart from the wiring and batteries) – the different robot parts, shields, modules and sensors.

# Step 2: Assembling the Chassis

The first thing to do is to assemble all the car chassis parts and attach the motors to the wheels. This is explained in detail in the video below.
